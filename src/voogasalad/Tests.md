### Possible Tests for VoogaSalad

The tests that we wanted to implement, once our code is refactored and working, are as follows:

1. Test if, when a user adds a unit, it is represented correctly. And if you change the image of a unit, that image is properly stored in its object.

2. Test if a unit's default abilities can be changed several times, i.e. if I set the default offensive ability as convert, then attack, that the default abilities properly represent that even after changing it real time.
